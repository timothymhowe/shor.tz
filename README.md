  Crosswords are a more than just a popular word puzzle. Depending on who you ask, they can be a hobby, a morning ritual, a way to kill time, a bonding activity, an intense competition, and an addiction.

  [In this guide](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle), The New York Times gives a straightforward explanation of how a solver should approach the puzzle.  Most importantly, it breaks down the following types of clues:
   - **Must Match:** The answer to a given clue generally must be in grammatical agreement with its clue, for example:
     - Tense
     - Part of Speech
     - Plurality
     - Language
   - **Cross Reference:**
   - **Partner:**
   - **Abbreviations:**
     - Abbr., as in “Lawyer: Abbr.” for the answer `ATTY`
     - Abbreviating a word in the clue itself, as in “Trial fig.,” short for “Trial figure,” also for ATTY, or “Elephant grp.” for `GOP`
     - For short, as in “Free TV spot, for short” for `PSA`
     - In brief, as in “Individual rights defender, in brief” for `ACLU`
     - sss
     - ** Puns: **

And like the clues, the themes tend to follow certain thematic elements, which are described
in detail on [Cruciverb](https://www.cruciverb.com/index.php?action=ezportal;sa=page;p=70).

It is not going to be possible to reckon with every type of theme. Some of them, such as those involving rebus squares,
are beyond the scope of this project.
